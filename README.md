# fc

It is meant to be a knowledge sharing system. Something like Confluence, but implemented better and cheaper for all of us.

NB: don't get me wrong -- Confluence is almost perfect, just not quite.

## business requirements

I need to keep everything in one place and be able to quickly search it all:

1. documentation ( articles, blog posts, charts, code snippets, etc )
2. meeting notes
3. decisions
4. project tracking ( something like Jira )
5. etc, etc, etc

NB: the base functionality, I believe, should be the one that allows me to create simple ( html ) documents and search for them.
Charts, meeting notes, decisions, project tracking -- all these should be implemented via modules.

NB: every single item is a document ( ? ). Every document can be linked to another document.
